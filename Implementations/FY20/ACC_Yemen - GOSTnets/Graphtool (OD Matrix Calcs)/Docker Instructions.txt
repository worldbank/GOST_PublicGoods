BEFORE setting up graphtool, place all required files in the graphtool folder. This includes: 
- final graph object(s)
- origins_100m_snapped.csv
- all destination .csvs, snapped. 

1.) docker pull tiagopeixoto/graph-tool

2.) Replace the path "C:/Users..." below with a path to whatever folder contains your desired notebooks

docker run --name GT -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -it -v C:\Users\charl\Documents\GOST\SierraLeone\graphtool:/home/user/home -w /home/user tiagopeixoto/graph-tool bash

If this command has an error, it is probably because the image is already running, in that case you can kill the service and start it again - this is useful if you want to map a different folder.
  	docker kill GT - kills process
        docker rm GT- releases the name 


3.) install necessary libraries with:
python -m ensurepip
python -m pip install networkx shapely

4.) navigate to the correct folder, run OD.py. Be sure to edit filenames first.
