# Measuring NTL in Afghanistan 
Nighttime lights data have proven to be effective proxies for numerous indicators of human activities in many situations: population, electrification, and economics to name a few. Herein we will use nighttime lights data to measure the changing nature of economic activity in Afghanistan following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in the summer of 2021.

## Workplan
1. Determine administrative boundaries to use for summarizing nighttime lights
2. Calculate sum of lights (SoL) for administrative boundaries
3. Map major military installations in Afghanistan
4. Calculate sum of lights (SoL) for administrative boundaries, excluding military bases

# Results
## Mapping administrative boundaries
The administrative boundaries of [GADM](https://gadm.org/index.html) and [GeoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/) are very similar, but there are differences. We will rely on GeoBoundaries in this analysis as it has better documentation and relevancy, but that can be changed later if desired.

## Calculate SoL for administrative boundaries.
