This archive contains all data science project implementations developed by GOST and collaborators over the years. The majority of them are python jupyter notebooks. Some were used as stand-alone scripts, while others build on reusable python packages.

### Structure

The notebooks have been grouped by year of project (FY), and with the following thematic codes:

**ACC: Market Access**  
Notebooks that deal with road networks to calculate market potential, access to different facilities, and different types of network analysis and criticality. Many of these use the GOSTnets repo.  

**SAT: Satellite Imagery**  
Workflows that query and process satellite imagery.  

**DEV: Development**  
Miscellaneous collection of scripts for bespoke data sources, or testing new methods.  

**EXP: Exposure**  
Intersection of flood data with other vector/raster data sources.
